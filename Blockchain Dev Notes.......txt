Noticing Person:

Blockchain was implemented Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.
The basic concept of cryptography was introduced by the Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stronetta in 1991.

The Blockchain protocol was introduced in 1982 by David Chaum.


The Problem:

To avoid the tampering of digital data being used.


The technology:

Blockchain is a decentralised digital lender.
A blockchain is a peer to peer in which the data blocks are being added after their completion and are sync in the chronological order which prevents it from stealing.


Blockchain is Further divided into EVM and TVM based which has its own set of working blockchain network.
Solidity is OOL used in EVM. And similarly the Vyper is a OOL in python language used in EVM. And aslo rust used in EVM.
Moonbeam / Moonriver is a blockchain in the common one in both of them which gives cross chain interoperability between Ethereum and Polkadot.

The framework they use are Hardhat and Foundry and more......

Tool used in security such as a Slither as an Solidity static analysis framework written in python 3.
Mythx is for EVM security and more......


Creation of Dapps:

Supported Languages: Go, Js, Python.
Frontend Frameworks: React, Vue, Angular

Use of client library to reduce the work to build the Blocks again for wheels.
Use of Client Nodes is use to verify blocks and transaction data.

Naas: Running your blockchain node is challenging, it complies services which help your in running nodes like Infure, Alchemy, etc..
